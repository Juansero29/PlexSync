# PlexSync

This is a _WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP) as of 12th December 2024_

## Description

The tool aims to provide synchronization of watchlist, watch history and ratings between Plex and other services.

First aim will be to provide synchronization with SensCritique, communicating with its GraphQL API thanks to the work done on [senscritique-graphql-api](https://github.com/NitriKx/senscritique-graphql-api) by [NitriKx](https://github.com/NitriKx/).

This is a side project and in active development so not currently working.

## Glosary

- SC: [SensCritique](https://www.senscritique.com/)

## Current Challenges

None. I am now able to retrieve all active items in the wish list of an user. I just need to get on with goal number one whenever I have the time.

## Goals

In order of priority

1. Create a function that removes an item (specified by id) from Plex watchlist
1. Create a function that removes an item (specified by id) from SC wish list
1. Create a function that synchronizes the wishes/watchlist between Plex and SC
   1. It should check that an item is not already in the list
   1. It should check that the two lists are identical at the end
      1. If lists are not identical, output the items that are missing and where they are missing
1. Create a function that gets every film/series with a rating in Plex
1. Create a function that gets every film/series with a rating in SC
1. Create a function that puts all Plex ratings into SC
1. Create a function that puts all SensCritique ratings into Plex
1. Create a function that merges all ratings
   1. It gets all ratings from Plex and the rating date (or last watched date if not available)
   1. It gets all ratings from SC and the date of rating (or last watched date if not available)
   1. Gets a list of films that are rated in both Plex and SC
   1. For each film in the list, it puts the latest rating in both platforms

## Contribute

If you want to contribute:

- Help me understand and document the GraphQL API, as most of its methods are obscure and have no related documentation even thoug the names are good leads
- Create the functions mentioned above to progress inside the project
- Write clean code (cf. [Clean Code Book](https://github.com/jnguyen095/clean-code/blob/master/Clean.Code.A.Handbook.of.Agile.Software.Craftsmanship.pdf))

Hereâ€™s the rewritten version for Python:

## Before Running

1. **Clone the Repository**

   - Use the following command to clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone <repository_url>
     cd <repository_directory>
     ```

2. **Create an Environment File**

   - Create a file at the root of the repository named `.env` with the following content:

     ```plaintext
     SC_EMAIL=senscritiquemail@yourmail.com
     SC_PASSWORD=yoursenscritiquepassword
     PLEX_IP=your_plex_server_ip
     PLEX_TOKEN=your_plex_api_token
     ```

   - **Important**: This file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. Ensure that you do not commit this file to keep your Plex and SensCritique credentials safe.

3. **Install Dependencies**

   - Run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run or Deploy the Project**
   - Follow the instructions in the "Compiling & Deploying" section to run or deploy the project.

---

This structure aligns with Python development practices and emphasizes security with `.env` files. Let me know if you need further adjustments!

## Compiling & Deploying

Commands to run and deploy the project.

## Running Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Installs required Python libraries.
2. **Run the Script**:
   - `python main.py` - Executes the project.

### Running Locally Using Docker

1. **Build Docker Image**:
   - `docker build -t plexsync .` - Builds the Docker image.
2. **Run Docker Container**:
   - `docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 plexsync` - Deploys and runs the Docker container.

### Clean Recompiling After Errors

1. **Remove Cached/Generated Files**:
   - `rm -rf __pycache__` - Removes Python cache files.
   - `rm -rf dist` - Removes any previous build directory (if applicable).
2. **Rebuild Dependencies**:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Reinstalls all dependencies.
3. **Clean Docker Environment**:
   - `docker system prune -f` - Removes unused Docker images and containers.
4. **Rebuild Docker Image**:
   - `docker build -t plexsync .` - Rebuilds the Docker image.
5. **Run the Clean Docker Build**:
   - `docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 plexsync` - Deploys and runs the clean build.

---

This format reflects the typical workflow for Python projects and adapts the instructions for Python-specific tools and environments. Let me know if you need additional details or adjustments!

## Overcome Challenges

### Wishlist retrieving wrong items

1. SensCritique seems to either cache info or have some latency in their GraphQL
   1. So recently added items into the Wishes are not returned by the API calls. This may need sometime to refresh and get returned by the API. I have added an item at 18h45 - 12/12/2024, and it's not returned immediately.
   1. I've made it so the function executes every 30 seconds until something is retrieved, I'll leave my PC on with the script running. We'll see at what time it will return something. Let's hope they don't ban me or detect me as a bot lol
   1. If new items in Wishes are never returned, then something is wrong with either my query or GraphSQL for SensCritique module => more tests to be done :/
   1. It's now 18h49 and nothing is returned yet.
1. Found another request in postman that allowed me to query for wishes of a specific user without having to authenticate.

### Wishlist not retrieving

~~As of now I'm focusing on extracting my own "Wishlist" from SensCritique via GraphQL, which is now partially working, since it succesfully authenticates with SensCritique and returns a list of movies that I have interacted with in the past, but that are not actually in my "Wishlist"~~

~~I'm trying to understand what "myWishes" query returns from the GraphQL API of SensCritique, which is not very clear to me as of now.~~

Old code causing trouble

```ts
async function getSensCritiqueWishlist() {
  const client = await SensCritiqueGqlClient.build(
    process.env.SC_EMAIL!,
    process.env.SC_PASSWORD!,
    {
      headers: {
        "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
      },
    }
  );

  const query = gql`
    query {
      myWishes {
        id
        title
        year_of_production
      }
    }
  `;

  const data = await client.request(query);
  console.log("Wishlist from SensCritique:", data.myWishes);
}
```

Current output:

```pwsh
Using SensCritique account: juansero29@gmail.com
Wishlist from SensCritique: [s\PlexSync>
  { id: 40631247, title: 'Severance', year_of_production: 2022 },
  { id: 7937926, title: 'Utopia', year_of_production: 2013 },
  { id: 43263904, title: 'The White Lotus', year_of_production: 2021 },
  { id: 42234, title: 'The Office (US)', year_of_production: 2005 },
  { id: 374603, title: 'Les Soprano', year_of_production: 1999 }
]
```

Was fixed by doing filtering on the isWished field
